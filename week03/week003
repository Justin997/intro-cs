Hi ethan, I ran the code file. Here is the errors: Line 4 for this question
#question number 5 for week 3 homework
def prime_num(num):
    num = input(int("please enter a number to check whether it is prime or not")               
                for x in range(2, num):
                if num % x == 0:
                print("This number is not prime")
                break
#Now if the remainder is not 0
                elif x in range(2, num, 1):
                    if num % x != 0:
                        print("this number is Prime")
                        
This has no error
def circle_area(radius):
    """Return the value times the radius squared"""
    Area = radius ** 2 * 3.14
    return Area

This also has no error
def triple(n):
    """Give a value for n"""
    New = n*n + n*n*n
    return New
    
    I almost got the last one, but can you check the syntax? Thank you
    #My goal on this function. What I found is that n = the number of columns and rows
# We dont want reptition of any of the number and when user type in a value for n
# the function lists the interval between 1 to that number, also n cannot be
def pattern(n):
    n = int(input("please enter the number"))
    for z in range(0, n+1):
                print(z,end" ")
            print ""
